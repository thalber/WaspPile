I've felt your presence, little spirit, as you ascended this monument.
Your attunement is very close to ours, but... different. Still grounded.
This chance you've been given is an unimaginable gift.
Do you remember when you descended into that dark sea?<LINE>Do you remember how it felt to be twisted and spat out?
Let that feeling drive you. You can still be saved.
This eternal frost can melt beneath the glory of the morning sun.
You've found a way.
