40 : 10 : Finally here.
The overseers were so insistant on informing me of your every move. Yet all that I see now is a meager ghost.
Reports indicated you had a payload. Where is it?
10 : 70 : ...
Were they wrong? Did you lose it? If images of you weren't so corrupt, I'd see for myself.
And despite your unusual nature, you stare as blankly as the lowest of beasts.
Why are you even here, specter?<LINE>Did you decide to take a stroll in this unstable shell out of sheer boredom?
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're mocking me.<LINE>Just a cruel reminder of my abandoned work.
So much effort and anticipation - all for nothing. Next time I will not bother.
You may continue your tour as you wish. I don't care.
Get out.
