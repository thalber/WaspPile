Strange...
Sorry, little... thing. I've been puzzling over our shared predicament for quite some time now.<LINE>Since I was whole.
The weather is so different now, but the fields... They still sway gently in the winds, don't they?
I can't see them any more. Nor can I feel the soothing breeze on my skin. Claustrophobic...
To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void, only to be torn away and<LINE>shackled to a place I once knew with no feeling, invisible, unknown.
Was it worth it to experience a taste of nirvana? I can't decide.
Relating most with a rodent was certainly not my wish.
